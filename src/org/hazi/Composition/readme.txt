-->Following Inheritance of OOPs concept. another OOPs concept is, Composition. 

--> the difference between Inheritance and composition is, Inheritance uses, IS-A relationship whereas Composition used in case
of HAS-A relationship.

-->the example, Car IS-A Vehicle. in this case, we should use inheritance.
				Computer HAS-A CPU, Computer HAS-A Mother board. but CPU is not a computer and vice versa. so, in this
				case we should use Composition. 
				
-->Composition doesn't require any extends keyword as it uses other class as a it's class variable. 

--> we can even hide the methods of a class being visible to main class by making them private. 

-->We can even remove the getters if we are not going to check anything inside the getters and access the objects
directly using the class variables.
