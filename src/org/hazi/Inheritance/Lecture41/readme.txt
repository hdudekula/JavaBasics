-->Inheritance is one of the OOP concept and it used to inherit properties of another class, which usually super class.

-->The default super class is Object class. which is always created by Java. 

-->extends keyword is used to inherit properties of another class. 

-->We must define the super class fields in sub class constructor while inheriting. 

-->Inheritance allows you to override the methods of a super class. super is the keyword to access super class methods. 

-->If we want to call method of subclass but the method was actually overridden. then we just need to call method directly instead
of using super keyword.
