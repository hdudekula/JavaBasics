-->List is something like grocery list, employee list or anything we use in real world. 

-->We can achieve the list in Java program with the help of ArrayList. ArrayList is a class and allow us to define the list and play around. 

-->The advantage of having ArrayList is, it adjusts the size itself. We need not to specify any size...if we keep adding lists, then the size
will increase automatically and if we delete anything then size will decrease automatically.

-->Inside ArrayList, we have different ways to access the list of contents inside Array. indexOf is used to get position of the value.

-->we use ArrayList<String> strArray = new ArrayList<String>(); and it takes the strings without any errors but however, we can't do 
ArrayList<int> intArray = new ArrayList<int>(); as arraylist wont allow primitive data types. It allows only class references. 

--> The above disadvantage has been overcome by using autoboxing and unboxing concept.
