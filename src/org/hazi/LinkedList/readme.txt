-->LinkedList is having advantages over using ArrayList in terms of memory usage and slowness. 

-->LinkedList contains link to next value of it's immediate value so we use hasNext() for linked list. 

-->We use LinkedList<> just like we use ArrayList<>. 

-->There is one more functionality which is, Iterator. which works like a for loop in array list. It iterates through the list and returns the
required value. 

-->Just like arraylist, we can add items in between the list and it always ensure to have link with it's immediate item.

-->LinkedList is also called as double linked list as even we can go in reverse order to manipulate the data.

-->listIterator.next() is only method allows to point to first item. listIteraotor.previous() contains values in reverse order. (last to first)

-->listIterator.hasNext() returns true if it has items in forward direction. listIterator.hasPrevious() returns true if it contains items in 
reverse direction.

-->difference between iterator and listIterator is, Iterator can traverse(loop) through the list and also set the values where as listIterator
can only traverse through the list in both the directions.
