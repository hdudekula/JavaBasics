-->Lambda expressions are used to shorten the code when using interfaces with single method. Like Runnable interface has only run(), in
that case we can use lambda expression to reduce the code and focus on body. 

-->Lambda expressions in some cases or often used in anonymous classes. 

-->Lambda expression has three parts. 1)argument, 2)error token and 3)body.

-->Lambda expressions can be used in place of functional interfaces. refer Oracle doc to know, on which interfaces we can use lambda
expressions. Comparator is one of the functional interface as it has only compare method. (though equals is also method but its default so, 
it can be considered as a interface with single method).
