-->Abstract class are similar to Interfaces. It also has unimplemented methods which needs to be implemented in their subclasses.

-->Abstract classes can be declared with keyword abstract. even methods inside abstract classes should be declared with keyword abstract.

-->We can't instantiate abstract classes. We have to extend and by implementing abstract methods. 

-->Abstraction will be useful to hide the inner functionalities and allow us to show only required things to outside world. 

-->Interface methods should be public where as Abstract methods need not to have specific scope. it can be public, private or anything.

-->Interfaces doesn't have constructors whereas we can implement constructor for Abstract classes.

-->Abstraction challenge is not implemented fully. Make note of it.
