-->Another concept of OOPs  is, Interface. 

-->Interface is a abstract class with signature, where it doesn't have implemented methods and calling class should implement all of it's
methods. 

-->It is mandatory to implement all the methods defined in interface in calling class. 

--> Interfaces can be used in CAN - BE relationship. like, Bird can fly and can walk so, we can implement fly interface and walk interface by
extendinng animal class. 

-->Java internally make use of Interfaces in very well manner. 

--> In our previous tutorials, wherever we have ArrayList/LinkedList, we can replace them with List as all of these are implemented from
List Interface. 

--> The advantage of creating of instace of Interface is, we can use the same methods for any other classes.
