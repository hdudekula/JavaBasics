--> Maps inside Collections framework are implemented as HashMap and ListMap.

--> The example for Map is, dictionary. In dictionary, a word will be mapped to its definition. in the same way, Map in java works.

-->Unlike in dictionary, Map in Java doesn't have any duplicates. 

-->Usually syntax for Map is, Map(key, Value). In order to insert value to Map, one has to use instance.put and to get value, we need to
use instance.get. Please see MapsProgram demo.
