--> Constructor are similar to methods but with special features. Constructor should always be with the name of the class. 
and public as access specifier. It doesn't require any return keyword. 

-->Constructor is the first method which is executed by system when the object is created. If we dont create it, system
itself create a default constructor and use it. 

-->Like methods, we can overload constructors as well. 

--> we can call one constructor from another constructor using this(). but, ensure, this() should be the first method
after immediate constructor definition. 

--> Inside constructor, we can assign parameter to fields in order to avoid usage of setters. this is possible by using
this keyword. 

--> We can avoid duplicate coding by using constructors in well manner.
